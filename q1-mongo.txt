We have a Mongoose model called stars.

"use strict";

var mongoose = require("mongoose"),
    Schema = mongoose.Schema;

var Stars = new Schema({
    // Entity is a unique id we use to track progress by each individual user
    entity: {type: Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: "Entity"},
    game:  {type: Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: "Game"},
    // Each mapping can have various levels of difficulty called progression_level
    progression_level: Number,
    stars_earned: Number,
    created_date: {type: Date, default: Date.now},
    location: Schema.Types.Mixed,
}, { collection: "Stars", versionKey: false });

module.exports = Stars;



Without getting bogged down in irrelevant data from the model above please provide a high level representation of what you believe the output of this query to be, as well as what the purpose may be for.

return module.exports.aggregate([
    {
        $match: {
        user_name: {$exists: true},
        location: {$exists: true}
        }
    },{
        $group: {
        _id: {entity: "$entity"},
        stars: {$sum: "$stars_earned"},
        user_name: {$first: "$user_name"},
        location: {$first: "$location"},
        }
    },{
        $project: {
        _id: 0,
        stars: 1,
        user_name: 1,
        country: "$location.country"
        }
    },{
        $sort: {stars: -1}
    },{
        $limit: limit || 20
    }
])

Aggregation is a way of processing a large number of documents in a collection by means of passing them through different stages. Here aggregation is performed on the data stored in the ‘Stars’ collection.

The Output of the above query would be an array of objects where each object represents a group of stars earned 
by each entity. Each object would contain three fields stars, user_name and location excluding the _id field. 
The stars field contains the stars_earned for the group, the username would contain the username of the first 
document in the group that has nonempty values, and the country field would contain the country value from the 
location.country of the same document. The resulting array would be sorted in descending order and limited to a maximum record of 20.
