We have a list of icons that are idential except for in colour that are used around the site multiple times (as well as on other sites) - so we want to use sass to generate the bulk of the css for each icon. The list is updated often so it's important that it is easy to add/change/remove items from the list without affecting any other files.

Provide the sass to translate the following information into just a few lines code.

CLASS    COLOUR
----------------
button-1 #ff65a9

button-2 #8ec429

button-3 #f46600

button-4 #00ab8b

#Answer Below -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
@each $class, $color in (
  button-1: #ff65a9,
  button-2: #8ec429,
  button-3: #f46600,
  button-4: #00ab8b
) {
  .#{$class} {
    background-color: $color;
  }
}
