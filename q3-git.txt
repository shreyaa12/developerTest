Consider the below branches

topic:    t1 <- t2 <- t3

master: <---------------- m1 <- m2 <- m3 

1. Draw resulting graph for `git merge master topic`

2. Draw resulting graph for `git rebase topic` while on master

3. When is rebase useful?

#Answer Below -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1)

           t1 - t2 - t3
          /             \
m1 -- m2 -- m3 --------- M
In this graph, 'topic' branch is merged into 'master' branch with a new merge 'M' 
with parent commits m3 and t3. Thus, the new merger contains commits from both the branch.


2)
                    t1N - t2N - t3N
                   /
m1 -- m2 -- m3 -- M

In this graph, topic branch is rebased onto master branch, 
there will be three new commits t1N, t2N, and t3N that show the changes from 
topic branch onto master branch. The M commit still exists as the merge base of
master and topic branches, but the changes from topic are now merged into 
the master branch history.

3) Rebase means Reapplying commits on top of another base tip. It is useful when we 
have to merge one branch to other branch while maintaining the history sequenctially. It helps 
to read the commit history and understand it, when there are multiple branches.
As it changes the commit history the command should be used carefully.But,on the other side
it keeps the branch upto date with the lastest and past changes.
