# Requirements
Style and add basic actions to a todo list. 
Todo's have a 'type' that is selected via the dropdown that determines their styling.

There's no rules for styling other than todo type should affect the style (ex. 'work' todos are orange, 'home' todos are blue), so make it look nice to yourself. 
Actions to implement:
1. Add task
2. Edit task
3. Delete task
